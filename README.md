# Newspaper Owner Financial Interests (1870-1890)

A Python-based research project analyzing the financial interests of American newspaper owners during the Gilded Age (1870-1890).

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and analysis for investigating the economic ties and financial interests of newspaper proprietors in late 19th-century America. The project combines historical data sources with modern computational methods to explore questions about media ownership and potential conflicts of interest during this formative period in American journalism.

**Status:** Work in progress (as of February 7, 2025)

## Data Sources

- [Melissa Dell's American Stories Dataset](https://github.com/dell-research-harvard/americanstories)
- Historical newspaper directories (1870-1890)

Geo. P. Rowell and Co.’s American Newspaper Directory was a directory to US newspapers and periodicals published in the mid-to-late 19th century, first published in 1869. 14 total scanned editions were used to assemble a dataset of American newspapers over
time from 1869 to 1890.3 This contains newspapers listed in Rowell’s, with their location, circulation, frequency of distribution, and most importantly, editors and owners for each year in the dataset.
